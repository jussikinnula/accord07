If the vehicle needs to be towed, call a professional towing service. Never tow the vehicle behind another vehicle with just a rope or chain. It is very dangerous.
</div>
<div>
<b>
Emergency Towing
</b>
</div>
<div>
There are three popular methods of towing a vehicle.
</div>
<div>
<b>
Flat-bed Equipment −
</b>
 The operator loads the vehicle on the back of a truck. 
<b>
This is the best way of transporting the vehicle.
</b>
</div>
<div>
To accommodate flat-bed equipment, the vehicle is equipped with front towing hooks (A), rear towing hook (B), front tie down hook slots (C), and rear tie down hook slots (D).
</div>
<div>
The towing hook can be used with a winch to pull the vehicle onto the truck, and the tie down hook slots can be used to secure the vehicle to truck.
</div>
<div>
<b>
Wheel Lift Equipment −
</b>
 The tow truck uses two pivoting arms that go under the tyres (front or rear) and lifts them off ground. The other two wheels remain on the ground. This is an acceptable way of towing the vehicle.
</div>
<div>
<b>
Sling-type Equipment −
</b>
 The tow truck uses metal cables with hook on the ends. These hooks go around parts of the frame or suspension and the cables lift that end of the vehicle's off the ground. The vehicle's suspension and body can be seriously damaged if this method of towing is attempted.
</div>
<div>
If the vehicle cannot be transported by flat-bed, it should be towed with the front wheels off the ground. If due to damage, the vehicle must be towed with the front wheels on the ground, do the following:
</div>
<div>
<b>
Manual Transmission
</b>
</div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<div>
Release the parking brake.
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
Shift the transmission in Neutral.
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<b>
Automatic Transmission
</b>
</div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<div>
Release the parking brake.
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
Start the engine.
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
Shift to the D position, then N position.
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
Turn off the engine.
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
It is best to tow the vehicle no father than 80 km (50 miles), and keep the speed below 55 km/h (35 mph).
</div>
<div>
<img src="../img/NOTICE_EN.PNG">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<div>
Improper towing preparations will damage the transmission. Follow the above procedure exactly. If you cannot shift the transmission or start the engine, the vehicle must be transported on a flat-bed.
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
Trying to lift or tow the vehicle by the bumpers will cause serious damage. The bumpers are not designed to support the vehicle's weight.
</div>
