General Operation
</b>
</div>
<div>
Refer to the Honda Navigation System Owner's manual, for the navigation system operating procedures.

<b>
Symptom Diagnosis
</b>
</div>
<div>
Certain circumstances and system limitations will result in occasional vehicle positioning errors. Some customers may think this indicates a problem with the navigation system when, in fact, the system is normal. Keep the following items in mind when interviewing customers about navigation system symptoms.
</div>

<div class="servinfosub_title">
<b>
Self-Inertial Navigation Limitations
</b>
</div>
<div>
The limitations of the self-inertial portion of the navigation system (the yaw rate sensor and the vehicle speed signal) can cause some discrepancies between the vehicle's actual position and the indicated vehicle position (GPS vehicle position). However, if GPS signals cannot be received, you must tune the vehicle's position manually.
</div>
<div>
The following circumstances may cause vehicle positioning errors:
</div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<div>
Moving the vehicle with the engine stopped, such as by ferry or tow truck, or if the vehicle is spun on a turn table
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
Tire slippage, changes in tire rolling diameters, and some driving situations may cause discrepancies in travel distances. Examples of this include:
</div>
</li>
<table class="Viewer">

<b>
Global Positioning System (GPS) Limitations
</b>
</div>
<div>
The GPS cannot detect the vehicle's position during the following instances:
</div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<div>
For the first 5 to 10 minutes after reconnecting the battery
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
When the satellite signals are blocked by tall building, mountains, tunnels, large trees, or large trucks
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
When the GPS antenna is blocked by something on the dashboard
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
When there is no satellite signal output (Signal output is sometimes stopped for satellite servicing)
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
When the satellite signals are blocked by the operation of some electronic aftermarket accessories including, but not limited to non-OEM in-dash entertainment units (radio, CD players/changers)
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
The accuracy of GPS is reduced during these instances:
</div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<div>
When only two satellite signals can be received (Three satellite signals are required for accurate positioning)
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
When the satellite control centers are experiencing problems
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="iG05">
</a>
<div class="servinfosub_title">
<b>
LCD Display Unit Limitations
</b>
</div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<div>
In cold temperatures, the display may stay dark for the first 2 or 3 minutes until it warms up.
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
When the display is too hot because of direct summer sunlight, it will remain dark until the temperature drops.
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
When the humidity is high and the interior temperature is low, the display may appear cloudy. The display will clear up after some use.
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
Fingerprints on the touch panel may sometimes be noticeable because of the panel's low-reflection coating. When cleaning the panel, wipe it gently with a soft cloth. To avoid scratching the panel, do not rub too hard or use abrasive cleaners.
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
The touch panel is an infrared system, so there is no need to press hard. If a touch switch does not function immediately, shift your finger slightly, and touch it again.
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
NOTE: Input may be affected by direct sunlight.

<b>
Symptom Duplication
</b>
</div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<div>
When the symptom can be duplicated, follow the self-diagnostic procedures and the appropriate troubleshooting procedures.
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
When the symptom does not reappear or only reappears intermittently, ask the customer about the conditions when the symptom occurred.
</div>
</li>

<b>
Service Precautions
</b>
</div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<div>
When the battery is disconnected, the clock is reset to ‘‘0:00''. The clock will reset to the correct time after the system receives the GPS satellite signals.
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
After reconnecting the battery, you have to wait to get the initial signal from the satellite. It will take about 10 minutes.
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
<a href="javascript:parent.Cts('000000000000305','i000')">
After reconnecting the battery, do the power window control unit resetting procedure.
</a>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
Before returning the vehicle to the customer, enter the radio code, then enter the customer's radio station presets, and set the clock. 
<a href="javascript:parent.Cts('000000000000757','i000')">
Do the engine control module (PCM) idle learn procedure.

</div>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="iG08">
</a>
<div class="servinfosub_title">
<b>
After Servicing-Map Matching
</b>
</div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<div>
Park the vehicle in an area where the GPS satellite signals will be unobstructed, and check the satellite mark on the display.
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
Drive the vehicle 1 mile before entering a destination and confirm the road being used is displayed at the bottom of the screen (map matched).
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
Enter the dealer address and confirm the system routes and performs normally.
